## Project Overview

The **ITER Data Fusion Lab** aims to merge physics and data science to tackle challenges in energy efficiency and sustainability. Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in data analysis and simulation, utilizing real-world datasets to understand complex scientific concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LNdubib/iter-data-fusion-lab.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd iter-data-fusion-lab
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas jupyter
```

### Running the Project

You can run the Jupyter notebooks directly in your browser. Use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your browser where you can access the notebooks.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze datasets from Eurostat and pwiDB.
- **Simulations**: Run simulations related to nuclear fusion.
- **Visualizations**: Create insightful visualizations using Python libraries.
- **Interdisciplinary Learning**: Integrate knowledge from physics and data science.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and simulations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.

## Data Sources

We utilize data from:

- **Eurostat**: A source for European statistics.
- **pwiDB**: A database focused on plasma-waves interaction.

These datasets provide a rich foundation for analysis and simulation, enabling students to explore real-world applications of their learning.
